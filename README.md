# ðŸ¦€ Practical Networked Applications (PNA) in Rust

A training course about practical systems software construction in Rust.

- This is my implementation of Projects 1 to 4 from the [PingCAP Talent Plan][pna_talent_plan] PNA Course:
  - [TP 201: Practical Networked Applications in Rust][pna_tp201]. A series of projects that incrementally develop a single Rust project from the ground up into a high-performance, networked, parallel and asynchronous key/value store. Along the way various real-world Rust development subject matter are explored and discussed.
- It was also a good use-case to deep dive into GitHub Actions and see how it compares to GitLab CI.

### ðŸ“‘ Project outline:

- [Project 1: The Rust toolbox][project_1]
- [Project 2: Log-structured file I/O][project_2]
- [Project 3: Synchronous client-server networking][project_3]
- [Project 4: Concurrency and Parallelism][project_4]
