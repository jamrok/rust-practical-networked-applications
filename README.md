# ü¶Ä Practical Networked Applications (PNA) in Rust

[![Code Checks][badge_gha_checks]][gha_checks]
[![Security Audit][badge_gha_audit]][gha_audit]

A training course about practical systems software construction in Rust.

- This is my implementation of Projects 1 to 4 from the [PingCAP Talent Plan][pna_talent_plan] PNA Course:
  - [TP 201: Practical Networked Applications in Rust][pna_tp201]. A series of projects that incrementally develop a single Rust project from the ground up into a high-performance, networked, parallel and asynchronous key/value store. Along the way various real-world Rust development subject matter are explored and discussed.
- It was also a good use-case to deep dive into GitHub Actions and see how it compares to GitLab CI.

### üìë Project outline:

- [Project 1: The Rust toolbox][project_1]
- [Project 2: Log-structured file I/O][project_2]
- [Project 3: Synchronous client-server networking][project_3]
- [Project 4: Concurrency and Parallelism][project_4]

### ü™ù Git Hooks
[Git Hooks][git_hooks] are in the [.hooks](.hooks) directory.

Run [`.hooks/enable`](.hooks/enable) or [`.hooks/disable`](.hooks/disable) to enable or disable them respectively.

The main hook is [`.hooks/pre-commit`](.hooks/pre-commit):
- It is a script that is triggered by the `git commit` command.
- It runs various commands in the script (similar to what is run in CI) to verify the files before completing the `git commit` command.
  - ‚ÑπÔ∏è Some commands in the script check the files in the working directory, not only the files staged for commit.
  - ‚ÑπÔ∏è Ensure everything you want to commit is staged as they will be committed if the checks pass.
- To skip triggering this hook, append `-n` or `--no-verify` to the `git commit` command you ran.
